This event is welcoming and respectful of trans women. Men are welcome as guests of women who are attending (please RSVP as well).</p> <p>On Friday evening you'll set up your development environment and start learning Python through a self-directed tutorial and online practice problems.</p> <p>On Saturday we'll spend the morning on a lecture-based introduction to the language, taking breaks to practice concepts on bite-sized exercises. In the afternoon we'll break out into groups to practice Python through short projects on a variety of fun and practical topics.</p> <p>At the end of the workshop, we will help connect with the closest Python user group so that you may continue the learning Python well beyond the workshop.</p> <p>This workshop is based off of <a href=\"http://pyladies.com/\">PyLadies</a> and <a href=\"http://openhatch.org/\">Openhatch.org</a>\u2019s Intro to Python workshops. Our goal is to provide an environment in which women can develop their programming skills with confidence.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><b>Venue details</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/c/f/e/event_120228382.jpegThe\" class=\"linkified\">http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/c/f/e/event_120228382.jpegThe</a> event is hosted by AU School of communication and the AU Computer Science Department.
